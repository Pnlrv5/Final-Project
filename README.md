Structure:

<!DOCTYPE html>

<html lang="en">

<head>

    <meta charset="UTF-8">

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

    <title>My First Website</title>

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">  <!-- Link to your CSS file -->

</head>

<body>

    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>

    <p>This is a simple paragraph of text.</p>

</body>

</html>

<!DOCTYPE html>: Declares it as an HTML5 document.
<html>: The root element of your webpage.
<head>: Contains metadata like title and links to external stylesheets.
<title>: Sets the title that appears in the browser tab.
<body>: Where the visible content of your webpage goes.

Add CSS for Style:
Create a "style.css" file: In the same folder as your "index.html", create a new file named "style.css".
body {

    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;

    background-color: #f0f0f0;

    text-align: center;

}



h1 {

    color: #333;

}
body: Applies styles to the entire webpage.
font-family: Sets the font type.
background-color: Changes the background color.
